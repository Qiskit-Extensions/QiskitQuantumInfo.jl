## ATTENTION

`QiskitQuantumInfo.jl` is an experimental package that might be interesting to **expert** Qiskit users.

This package mirrors in Julia some qiskit data structures (in Python). At present these data structures are used as an intermediate
form in translating operators from [QuantumOps.jl](https://github.com/jlapeyre/QuantumOps.jl) to qiskit data structures.
